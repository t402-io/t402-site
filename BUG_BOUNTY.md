# T402 Bug Bounty Program

We invite security researchers to help us identify vulnerabilities in the T402 protocol. This program rewards responsible disclosure of security issues.

## Rewards

| Severity | Description | Reward |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Critical** | Loss of funds, signature bypass, unauthorized settlements | $1,000 - $10,000 |
| **High** | Replay attacks, authentication bypass, data exposure | $500 - $1,000 |
| **Medium** | Rate limit bypass, information disclosure, DoS | $100 - $500 |
| **Low** | Minor issues, best practice violations | $50 - $100 |

Rewards are paid in USDT on your preferred supported chain (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, TON, TRON, or Solana).

## Scope

### In Scope

#### Protocol & SDKs

| Component | Repository Path | Priority |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| TypeScript SDK | `typescript/packages/*` | High |
| Go SDK | `go/*` | High |
| Python SDK | `python/*` | High |
| Java SDK | `java/*` | Medium |

#### Facilitator Service

| Component | Path | Priority |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Core Service | `services/facilitator/*` | Critical |
| API Endpoints | `/verify`, `/settle`, `/supported` | Critical |
| Authentication | API key validation | High |
| Rate Limiting | Redis-based limiter | Medium |

#### Chain Mechanisms

| Chain | Components | Priority |
|-------|------------|----------|
| EVM | EIP-3009, EIP-712 signing, USDT0 | Critical |
| TON | Jetton transfers, wallet signing | Critical |
| TRON | TRC-20 transfers | Critical |
| Solana | SPL token transfers | Critical |

### Out of Scope

- Third-party dependencies (report upstream)
- USDT/USDT0 smart contracts (report to Tether)
- Blockchain consensus issues
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security attacks
- Issues in test/example code only
- Already known issues (check existing advisories)
- Denial of service via rate limiting (expected behavior)

---

## Vulnerability Categories

### Critical

- Unauthorized token transfers
- Signature forgery or bypass
- Replay attacks across chains or sessions
- Authentication bypass in facilitator
- Private key exposure
- Remote code execution

### High

- Cross-site scripting (XSS) in paywall
- SQL/NoSQL injection
- Improper access control
- Sensitive data exposure
- Session hijacking
- API key leakage

### Medium

- Rate limit bypass
- Information disclosure (non-sensitive)
- Denial of service (application-level)
- Improper input validation
- Missing security headers
- Verbose error messages

### Low

- Best practice violations
- Minor configuration issues
- Code quality issues with security implications
- Missing rate limiting on non-critical endpoints

---

## Rules

### Do

- Test only against testnet/development environments
- Report vulnerabilities promptly
- Provide detailed reproduction steps
- Keep findings confidential until resolved
- Allow reasonable time for fixes (see response timeline)

### Don't

- Test against production systems without permission
- Access or modify other users' data
- Perform denial of service attacks
- Use automated scanners aggressively
- Publicly disclose before coordination
- Demand payment before providing details
