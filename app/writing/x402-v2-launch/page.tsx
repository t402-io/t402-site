                <strong>TL;DR</strong>: Building on six months of real-world use, t402 V2 expands the protocol beyond single-call, exact payments. It adds wallet-based identity (skip repaying on every call), automatic API discovery, dynamic payment recipients, support for more chains and fiat via CAIP standards, and a fully modular SDK for custom networks and schemes. All aimed at making t402 cleaner, more extensible, and future-proof, enabling unified payment models and wallet-based access for agents and humans alike.

              <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-70">
                t402 launched in May 2025 with a simple idea: embed payments directly into HTTP using the long-dormant 402 status code. In just a few months, it has processed over 100M payments across APIs, apps, and AI agents, powering everything from paid API calls to autonomous agents buying compute and data on-demand.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-70">
                V2 evolves the specification based on learnings from 6 months of t402 performing real-world payments:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-70">
                <li>Clearer separation between clients, servers, facilitators, and the t402 reference SDK</li>
                <li>Tweaks to the data type declarations to increase clarity, reduce redundancy, and make t402 easier to implement on new chains</li>
                <li>Formalizing the concept of &quot;Extensions&quot; to make it easier to experiment and extend t402 without the need to fork</li>
                <li>Moving all payment data to headers for the HTTP transport, freeing up response body to be used alongside a 402 status code and Payment Required header</li>
                <li>Bottoms up rewrite of the t402 reference SDK for a modular, composable architecture</li>
                <li>Migrating reference SDK to <code className="bg-green-100 px-1 rounded">@t402</code> npm org</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-70">
                At the same time, the mission of t402 remained constant:
              </p>
              <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-70 font-semibold">
                Enable value to move across the internet as seamlessly as information, whether the actor is a human, an app, or an agent.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-70">
                t402 V2 is designed to meet the demands of this next stage of the internet economy. It refactors the protocol to be cleaner, more interoperable, and more future-proof, while preserving everything that made V1 successful.

              <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-70">
                V2 is a major upgrade that makes the protocol more universal, more flexible, and easier to extend across networks, transports, identity models, and payment types. The spec is cleaner, more modular, and aligned with modern standards including CAIP and IETF header conventions, enabling a single interface for onchain and offchain payments.
              </p>

            <section className="space-y-4">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">1. Unified payment interface</h3>
              <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-70">
                t402 V2 standardizes how networks and assets are identified, creating a single payment format that works across chains and with legacy payment rails.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-70 font-medium">Key upgrades:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-70">
                <li><strong>Multi-chain by default</strong>: Supports stablecoins & tokens across Base, Solana, other chains, and new L2s, with no custom logic required</li>
                <li><strong>Compatible with legacy payment rails</strong>: Facilitators for ACH, SEPA, or card networks fit into the same payment model</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic &apos;payTo&apos; routing</strong>: Per-request routing to addresses, roles, or callback-based payout logic – perfect for marketplaces and multi-tenant APIs. This also adds dynamic pricing based on inputs.</li>
                <li><strong>No breaking changes</strong>: New ways to evolve functionality in extensions, rather than modifying the spec</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-70">
                <strong>So what</strong>: t402 becomes a flexible economic layer with usage-based, subscription-like, prepaid, and multi-step workflows all possible without changing your API architecture or upgrading the core spec.

              <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-70">
                V2 introduces a clear separation between the protocol specification, its SDK implementation, and facilitators, making the protocol plug-in-driven and future-proof.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-70 font-medium">Key upgrades:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-70">
                <li><strong>Stable spec</strong>: Adding new chains or payment behaviors requires zero changes to the standard of reference SDKs.</li>
                <li><strong>Plugin-driven SDK</strong>: Developers register chains, assets, and payment schemes instead of editing SDK internals.</li>
                <li><strong>Lifecycle hooks</strong>: Enable builders to inject custom logic at key points in the payment flow (e.g. before/after sending a payment, before/after settlement verification). This unlocks conditional payment routing, custom metrics, complex failure recovery mechanisms, and more.</li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Modernized HTTP headers</strong>:
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>Removes deprecated X-* headers for improved compatibility</li>
                    <li>Uses more modern PAYMENT-SIGNATURE, PAYMENT-REQUIRED, PAYMENT-RESPONSE</li>
                    <li><em>[coming very soon]</em> New SIGN-IN-WITH-X header</li>
                  </ul>

              </ul>
              <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-70">
                <strong>So what</strong>: t402 V2 becomes a plug-and-play platform. Anyone can add a new chain, facilitator, or payment model as a standalone package, without the overhead and coordination of modifying the underlying protocol.

            <section className="space-y-4">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">3. Wallet-based access, reusable sessions, and modular paywalls</h3>
              <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-70">
                V2 refactors key components related to identity and access, setting the stage for more efficient session management and making the server-side architecture highly flexible.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-70 font-medium">Key upgrades:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-70">
                <li><strong>Modular Paywall Package</strong>: The paywall has been completely overhauled and extracted into a dedicated, modular package: <code className="bg-green-100 px-1 rounded">@t402/paywall</code>. This allows developers to easily contribute new payment backends and create custom paywall variations (with built-in support for EVM and Solana).</li>
                <li><strong>Foundation for Reusable Access</strong>: The V2 protocol now includes the logic to support wallet-controlled sessions or other forms of identity, allowing clients to <strong>skip the full payment flow</strong> and the need for <strong>onchain interactions for repeated access</strong> if the resource was previously purchased.</li>
                <li><strong>Enables Subscription and Session Patterns</strong>: This architecture makes subscription-like or session-based access patterns possible for both human users and autonomous agents.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-70">
                <strong>Note on Sign-In-With-X (SIWx)</strong>: The full wallet-based identity feature, including the dedicated Sign-In-With-X (SIWx) header (based on CAIP-122), will be an immediate fast-follow launch item. This finalizes the first extensions for proving wallet control to access reusable sessions.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-70">
                <strong>So what</strong>: This combination improves the server-side developer experience and unlocks the core benefits of lower latency, fewer round-trips, and cheaper repeated calls. These efficiencies make t402 viable for high-frequency workloads like LLM inference, multi-call agents, and complex applications where paying per request would be too slow or expensive.
