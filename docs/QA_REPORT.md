### Critical Issues

None identified during QA phase.

### High Priority Issues

#### 1. TypeScript Build Errors (Multiple Packages) - FIXED

**Status**: **ALL FIXED** in commit `4013c20`

The following build issues were identified and resolved:

| Package | Issue | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `@t402/core` | Type re-exports violate `isolatedModules` | Changed to `export type { }` |
| `@t402/extensions` | Type re-exports violate `isolatedModules` | Changed to `export type { }` |
| `@t402/react` | Unused `React` import | Removed unused import |
| `@t402/evm` | Multiple unused imports/properties in ERC-4337 code | Removed unused code |
| `@t402/ton` | Unused imports and methods | Removed unused code |
| `@t402/tron` | Unused `_config` property | Used config for `preferredToken` |
| `@t402/wdk` | Unused imports and class properties | Removed unused code |
| `@t402/mcp` | Unused parameters in tools | Prefixed with underscore |

**Files Modified (25 total)**:
- `typescript/packages/core/src/http/index.ts`
- `typescript/packages/extensions/src/index.ts`
- `typescript/packages/extensions/src/bazaar/index.ts`
- `typescript/packages/http/react/src/providers/PaymentProvider.tsx`
- `typescript/packages/mechanisms/evm/src/erc4337/*.ts` (multiple files)
- `typescript/packages/mechanisms/evm/src/exact/server/scheme.ts`
- `typescript/packages/mechanisms/ton/src/exact/server/scheme.ts`
- `typescript/packages/mechanisms/tron/src/exact/server/scheme.ts`
- `typescript/packages/wdk/src/*.ts` (multiple files)
- `typescript/packages/mcp/src/tools/*.ts`

### Medium Priority Issues

#### 2. TRON Dynamic Require Path Issue - FIXED

**Status**: **FIXED** (Jan 15, 2026)

**Issue**: Dynamic `require("../../tokens.js")` in `getTokenByAddress()` failed in vitest due to module resolution.

**Fix**: Replaced dynamic require with static ESM import at the top of the file. The private `getTokenByAddress` method was removed and the imported function from `tokens.ts` is used directly.

**Files Modified**:
- `typescript/packages/mechanisms/tron/src/exact/server/scheme.ts` - Static import added, private method removed
- `typescript/packages/mechanisms/tron/test/server.test.ts` - 6 skipped tests now enabled and passing

**Result**: All 127 TRON tests now pass (0 skipped).

#### 3. EVM Integration Tests - ADDED

**Status**: **ADDED** (Jan 15, 2026)

**New Test Files** (4 files, 56 integration tests):
- `typescript/packages/mechanisms/evm/test/integrations/multi-network.test.ts` - 24 tests

**Result**: 134 unit tests + 88 integration tests = 222 total tests for @t402/ton.

### Low Priority Issues

#### 6. Unused Import Warning in TRON Client Test

**File**: `typescript/packages/mechanisms/tron/test/client.test.ts`
**Issue**: `vi` imported but some mocking features unused due to test scope changes
**Impact**: None (cosmetic)

---

## Security Considerations

### Items Requiring Security Review

1. **Private Key Handling**
   - Client signers across all SDKs
   - MCP server environment variable loading
   - No hardcoded keys found in codebase (good)

2. **Input Validation**
   - Address validation functions tested and working
   - Amount parsing with decimal precision verified
   - Network identifier normalization tested

3. **Signature Verification**
   - EIP-3009 authorization verified in EVM mechanism
   - TON Jetton signature handling tested
   - TRON TRC-20 signature flow documented

### Security Test Coverage

| Area | Coverage | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Address validation | High | Unit tests for all chains |
| Amount conversion | High | Edge cases covered |
| Network normalization | High | Invalid inputs tested |
| Signature creation | Medium | Mocked in unit tests |
| Signature verification | Low | Needs integration tests |
| Replay protection | Low | Needs integration tests |

### Recommendations for Security Audit

1. **Integration Testing**: Add end-to-end tests with testnet transactions
2. **Fuzz Testing**: Add property-based tests for input parsing
3. **Gas Estimation**: Verify gas limits are appropriate for all networks
4. **Error Messages**: Review for information leakage
5. **Rate Limiting**: Verify facilitator rate limiting is correctly implemented
