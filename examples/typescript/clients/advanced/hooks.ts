/**
 * Hooks Example
 *
 * This demonstrates how to register hooks for payment creation lifecycle events.
 * Hooks allow you to add custom logic at different stages:
 * - onBeforePaymentCreation: Called before payment creation starts, can abort
 * - onAfterPaymentCreation: Called after successful payment creation
 * - onPaymentCreationFailure: Called when payment creation fails, can recover
 *
 * This is an advanced feature useful for:
 * - Logging payment events for debugging and monitoring
 * - Custom validation before allowing payments
 * - Error recovery strategies
 * - Metrics and analytics collection
 *
 * @param evmPrivateKey - The EVM private key for signing
 * @param url - The URL to make the request to
