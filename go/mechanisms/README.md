# t402 Mechanisms

This directory contains **mechanism implementations** for the t402 protocol.

## What are Mechanisms?

**Mechanisms** are network-specific payment scheme implementations. A mechanism defines how payments are created, verified, and settled for a particular blockchain network and payment scheme.

For example:
- The **exact** scheme on **EVM** networks uses EIP-3009 for USDC transfers
- The **exact** scheme on **SVM** networks uses Solana token transfers

## Directory Structure

Mechanisms are organized by network type and scheme:

```
mechanisms/
├── evm/                    - Ethereum Virtual Machine networks
│   └── exact/              - Exact payment scheme for EVM
│       ├── client/         - Client-side: create payments
│       ├── server/         - Server-side: verify payments
│       └── facilitator/    - Facilitator-side: settle payments
│
└── svm/                    - Solana Virtual Machine networks
    └── exact/              - Exact payment scheme for SVM
        ├── client/         - Client-side: create payments
        ├── server/         - Server-side: verify payments
        └── facilitator/    - Facilitator-side: settle payments
```

## Mechanism Roles

Each mechanism has three role-specific implementations:

### Client Mechanisms

Create payment payloads that clients sign and send to servers.

- **Location**: `mechanisms/{network}/exact/client/`
- **Used by**: Applications making paid requests
- **Responsibilities**: Generate payment payloads with signatures

### Server Mechanisms

Verify payment requirements and validate payments (via facilitator).

- **Location**: `mechanisms/{network}/exact/server/`
- **Used by**: Services accepting payments
- **Responsibilities**: Build payment requirements, parse prices

### Facilitator Mechanisms

Verify signatures and settle payments on-chain.

- **Location**: `mechanisms/{network}/exact/facilitator/`
- **Used by**: Payment processing services
- **Responsibilities**: Verify signatures, submit blockchain transactions

## Supported Mechanisms

### EVM - Exact

Ethereum-based exact payments using EIP-3009.

**See:** [evm/README.md](evm/README.md)

### SVM - Exact

Solana-based exact payments using token transfers.

**See:** [svm/README.md](svm/README.md)

## Future Mechanisms

As new payment schemes are developed, they will be added to this directory:

### Planned Schemes

- **`upto`** - Pay up to a maximum amount based on resource consumption
- **`subscription`** - Recurring payment schemes
- **`batch`** - Batch multiple payments together

### Network Expansion

New network types can be added:

- **Bitcoin Lightning** - `lightning/exact/`
- **Cosmos** - `cosmos/exact/`
- **Polkadot** - `polkadot/exact/`

## Contributing New Mechanisms

We welcome contributions of new payment schemes and network implementations!

### Guidelines for New Mechanisms

When implementing a new mechanism:

1. **Follow the three-role pattern**: Implement `client/`, `server/`, and `facilitator/` packages
2. **Use the existing structure**: Place under `mechanisms/{network}/{scheme}/`
3. **Implement required interfaces**: Match the interfaces defined in the core package
4. **Include tests**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
5. **Document thoroughly**: Add README explaining the mechanism
6. **Follow conventions**: Use consistent naming and patterns

### Contribution Process

1. Open an issue describing the mechanism
2. Discuss the implementation approach
3. Submit a PR with:
   - Mechanism implementation (client, server, facilitator)
   - Tests
   - README documentation
   - Example usage

### Questions?

For questions about contributing mechanisms, please:
- Open a GitHub issue
- Reference existing mechanisms (EVM, SVM) as examples
- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for general guidelines
